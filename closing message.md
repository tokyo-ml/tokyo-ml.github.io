Fellow Model Trainers, Hyperparameter Tuners, Loss Function Designers,

First of all, we'd like to thank you for participating and speaking in our past Machine Learning Kitchen events. It has always been a pleasure to host you and share the passion with machine learning with you in the two years. We held eleven events (12 if you include the [Tech Kitchen: Show and Tell](https://cookpad.connpass.com/event/122585/)). Some of them together with another group, some 100% Cookpad. In all cases the talks were inspiring and the audience has always been warm and enthusiastic. It has always been a pleasure to host you in our Kitchen Lounge.

Starting this year, we have decided to stop organising ML Kitchen events. Instead, we want to focus our time and effort on other Cookpad events, as well as increase our presence in other Machine Learning groups in Tokyo. 

Please take a look at:
 - [Machine Learning Tokyo](https://machinelearningtokyo.com/)
 - [Tokyo Python Society Club](https://www.meetup.com/TokyoPythonSocietyClub/)
 - [Dev Japan](https://www.meetup.com/devjapan/) (often held in our office)
 - and Cookpad events: [Tokyo Rails](https://www.meetup.com/tokyo-rails/) and [many others](https://cookpad.connpass.com/)

Please follow [@cookpad_tech](https://twitter.com/cookpad_tech) on Twitter for updates on what's Cooking in Cookpad Tech, including our meetups and hackathons.

If you are curious about working at Cookpad, our open positions and work style, please take a look at our [career information page](https://info.cookpad.com/careers/). At the time of this writing, we are looking for [ML Researchers](https://cookpad.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/ja-JP/jobs/job/-/_R-000205) for our R&D team and also [Android, iOS, infra engineers and more](https://info.cookpad.com/careers/jobs/). Also, there's still time to apply for our [Summer Internship](https://internship.cookpad.com/2019/summer/#rd) program.


With best regards,
Leszek and the ML Kitchen Organiser Team
